# Reaction Time Tester with PySide6

## Description  
This project is a GUI-based reaction time tester built using **PySide6** (Qt for Python). The app prompts users to click as quickly as possible once a colored dot appears on the screen, measuring their reaction time in milliseconds. It also provides emoji-based feedback and logs results for future reference.

## Features

- **Name Input:** Personalized greeting based on the user's name.
- **Random Delay:** A dot appears after a random short delay to avoid anticipation.
- **Reaction Measurement:** Time is measured in milliseconds from dot appearance to mouse click.
- **Emoji Feedback:** Get different emojis based on your reaction speed.
- **Result Log:** View previous results in the UI and save to a local file (`sonuclar.txt`).
- **Audio Cue:** A sound is played when the dot appears.
- **Custom UI Styling:** Visually appealing interface with themed widgets.
